<h1> GTA5-Mods </h1>

This is a repository regrouping all of my featured gta 5 mods scripts

<b>TLDR</b> :

Easy Engine Control : 
	A mod that lets you control wether you want your engine On or Off in a similar fashion as GTA-IV's behaviour.
	Read more at "EasyEngineControl/README.md"

HideMinimapShortCut:
	This mod lets you hide your minimap whenever you press a key. No more having to go through GTA-V's menu to deactive the GUI !
	It also adds some more features related to the minimap. Check "HideMinimapShortcut/README.md" for more information.

HitmanReloaded:
	HitmanReloaded is a remix of a remix of a mod that gives you random Hitman scenarios, 
	letting you decide how you should handle them. Check "HitmanReloaded/README.md" for more information.

PickpocketScript: 
	This script is a request from one of GTA5-Mods.com's users. It allows you to pickpocket npcs by bumping into them.
	Please do check "PickpocketScript/README.md" before using it and for more information.
	Featured in : <a href='https://www.pcgamer.com/snatch-ifruit-smartphones-on-the-fly-with-this-gta-5-pickpocket-mod/'> pcgamer article </a>

SimplePowerPunch: 
	The SimplePowerPunch script is what it advertises : It increases the power of the player's punch/melee attack,
	throwing people into the air as contact is made. You get to choose at what strength, and with what model.
	Please do read "SimplePowerPunch/README.md" before using, as it contains critical information on how to use it.

Telekinesis: 
	What you see is what you get. You now have the ability to handle most objects with you "mind" (camera), pressing a key !
	You can then throw trashcans, cars, people, almost anything at the gangsters trying to get you !
	More details in "Telekinesis/README.md"
