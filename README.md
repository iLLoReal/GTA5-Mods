<b>SimplePowerPunch</b>:

	<b>Please</b> do read <b>"SimplePowerPunch/README.md"</b> before using, as it contains critical information on how to use it.

<b>Telekinesis</b>: 
	What you see is what you get. You now have the ability to handle most objects with you "mind" (camera), pressing a key !
	You can then throw trashcans, cars, people, almost anything at the gangsters trying to get you !
