<h1>Easy Engine Control</h1>
Have you ever wanted to just chill inside your vehicle, without having your engine on ? Or, on the contrary, you don't want to turn your engine off every time you step outside your car ?

This mod allows you to easily control your engine.

Important note :

There already exists a mod relative to exiting vehicles like we used to in IV.
here are the link to these mods :

these mods work as well, but i already started doing this one before i noticed
they existed. Beside, they haven't been updated in years, and the C# version seems to have a problem. Anyway, the point of Easy Engine Control is to be able to turn on and off the engine at will, and these two mods don't seem to allow that. But still, they are worth taking a look at, so feel free to check them out !

Another mod exists that i didn't know of until after i finished and released the mod : https://www.gta5-mods.com/scripts/ignition-engine-control-net#description_tab
End of important note

It basically reproduces IV style exiting vehicles, if you quickly press the "exit vehicle" button, your car engine will stay on, if you keep it down till you get out, your car engine will turn off.

In addition to that, it adds a button to turn on and off the engine. No more parking your car and not take the time to enjoy your vehicle's seat, like you would in real life !


Changelog
------------------------------
V1.1
* Fixed the following bug : when you turn off your vehicle, get out, get back in, and quickly exit the vehicle, the engine shuts down no matter what.




How To Install
------------------------------
1) Download the file
2) Extract "LeaveEngineRunning.cs"
3) Place "LeaveEngineRunning.cs" inside a folder named "scripts" in your main GTA V directory.
4) Install ScriptHookVDotNet & ScriptHookV

How To Use
------------------------------
Once installed, just play like you would have normally.
To turn the engine off manually, maintain the "Light Melee Attack" button (Default key is R) down. The same goes for turning it back on manually.

Note : Once you have turned the engine off manually, you don't need to use the button to turn it back on. You can also choose to push the "Accelerate" button.

If you exit your car after having turned the engine off manually, no matter how quick you press the button, the engine won't be on.
If you enter your car after that, the player will turn the engine on automatically, like he should.

this mod works great with my HideMinimap mod altogether with a police traffic regulation mod.
